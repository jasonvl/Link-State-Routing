# Link-State-Routing
This project contains the data structures and algorithms to support link-state routing and packet forwarding in a packet-switched network. This network supports both point-to-point and multicast communication. The program is be driven by a sequence of timestamped events (sorted by increasing time) read from an input file and the program will write output messages to a separate output file. Events in the simulation consist of link-state routing messages, multicast join and leave requests and packet arrivals. Whenever a link-state packet arrives, the program updates its data structures to maintain shortest path information to all hosts in the network. This shortest path information will then be used to build forwarding tables which will facilitate correct packet forwarding.
